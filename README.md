has information of 100k orders from 2016 to 2018 made at multiple marketplaces in Brazil. It 
provides multiple dimensions on an order namely: order status, price, payment and freight 
performance to customer location, product attributes and finally reviews written by customers. It 
also has a geolocation dataset that relates Brazilian zip codes to lat/lng coordinates.
